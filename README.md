# Independent-Study
This is the repository for Teddy Maiorca's independent study, beginning in Fall 2023 and ending in Spring 2024. The repo is home to my progress through HTML and CSS, and eventually JavaScript in D3. The ultimate goal is to create a sports graphics website using those 4 languages and R. Here we go!
